# Currency-Exchange
Web Developer Test - Neusoft EDC

Hello Neusoft!

I would first like to thank you for this opportunity.

Although I was a bit unfortunate to be quite sick in the past week and have not implemented all the requested features for the app I had fun working on it and enjoyed
its challanges.

I'm sure that if I had some more time or was feeling better I would have managed to either finish or make it a lot better. Anyway, below are some points regarding 
the current state of development of the app.

I wrote the app in Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 using an ASP.NET Core Web Application with Angular. 

Working Features
  - API calls for currency rates
  - API calls for currency symbols
  - Title and current date for exchange rates are displayed correctly.
  - Exchange rate short acronym + Long Name + value are displayed correctly.
  - Base rate exists although its only EURO and changing its input value will correctly display the values for other exchange rates.
  - Add Currency Button displays modal
  - Add Currency Modal works and exits as requested 
  - Add Currency Modal lists all the currencies with Short Name and Full Name.
  - Modal and cards from modal are seperate components.
  
Missing Feautres
  - Adding and removing currencies
  - Currency flags and currency symbols ($)
  - Changing base currency

Future improvements
  - Currency cards on the main page should have been a component rendered as many times as needed similar to the ones in the Add Currency Modal
  - Mobile and resolution improvements (currently on mobile resolution the app looks horrible :( )
  - Other syle improvments
  - ....many more that I can't think of right now
  
Thank you for reading!
George
